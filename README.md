## Testing
* [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - This document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG ! 

All links will function, clicking on the movies will open a new page which play the trailer of the chosen movie on YouTube.com. The "Send" button will return to the home section. Custom CCS code is written for every button comfort design.

This site was tested across multiple screen sizes on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explore to ensure compatibility and responsiveness it was also tested on an android based mobile device. When the webpage is visited on larger screens the carousel slide will take the whole screen This will have smaller height on a mobile such as Iphone 6/7/8 Plus. A navigation bar is shown all the time and will transform to an option bar on smaller phone screens.

Each time user hover a movie, the likes and views will show up with custom CSS to get user's attention about the movie's rating.

## Strategy
The goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design as possible.

## Technologies
* HTML - To create a basic site
* CSS - To create a nice style and to stand-out
* Bootstrap - To improve responsiveness
* Figma - To create mockup
* Git - Using Gitpod to edit html and css
* GitHub - To store the projects code after being pushed from Git
* Google Fonts- Google fonts were used to import the 'Titillium Web' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
* Font Awesome - Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

## Structure
The site is structured to get the right information as quickly as possible. A navigation bar that's always available to quickly scroll between pages. Contact form at the bottom. The proper order of the pages is created to trigger the reader to contact us.

## Known Issues
* The opacity of posters may not work in chrome (likes and views are always visible instead of visible only when hover)

## Credits
### Content
All content on this site were written by me.

All informations about movies is taken from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).

Trailers are taken from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

### Media
All photos were taken from google. Web's logo and fav icon is created by me.

### Acknowledgements
As a user, I likes watching movies for entertainment, but it's really expensive to buy movies all the time. However, to protect intellectual property is really important in order to encourage arts creativity. It would be great if we can have a website where we can watch movies freely, so people with low salary can also enjoy the movies and at the same time, to encourage arts creativity. So to achieve these two goals, the investors and the businessman use their funds for advertisement to buy movie rights.

So, for the first step, I want to create a web where user can see the new movies and can view them.

For the web design, the navbarToggler was found on bootstrap (by mentor advice) and the carousel slide was found on bootstrap (by mentor advice).
